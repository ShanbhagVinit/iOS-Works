\f0\fs24 \cf0 The image assets used in the sample project are from a James will s Autolayout Tutorial for Adaptive Layouts. I was undergoing this course from Pluralsight. All these images were used from the clone of Git repo of the sample project used for this Course. \
\
I have used the same images for my sample project that I tried out for myself for the sake learning. There is no other reason to use them apart from learning. I would suggest people who go through this project to use these images carefully as they are under MIT Licence.}
