# Constraints Priorities

Main aspect of auto layout in iOS are constraints. They are nothing but the linear equations. Example
y = mx + c
y is anchor of view1, m is some relatioanl ( =, =>, <=) , x refers to view2 and c is the constant

## Things i tried with this project

1. Create single view application project in xcode.
2. Drag UIButton on the viewcontroller provided in the Main.Storyboard
3. Clone two more copies of the button.
