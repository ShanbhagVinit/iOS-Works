## Pluralsight: Auto Layout Assets

These assets are provided for your convenience to complete Auto Layout courses on Pluralsight.  Clone or download this repository and create a new master-detail project in Xcode.  Add these images as assets to your project. 


##Please Note

The image assets used in the sample project are from a James will s Autolayout Tutorial for Adaptive Layouts. I was undergoing this course from Pluralsight. All these images were used from the clone of Git repo of the sample project used for this Course. 

I have used the same images for my sample project that I tried out for myself for the sake learning. There is no other reason to use them apart from learning. I would suggest people who go through this project to use these images carefully as they are under MIT Licence.
